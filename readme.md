# Restaurant Management System
This readme file provides an overview and instructions for the Restaurant Management System, a database project designed using SQL. The system includes three user interfaces catering to the manager, customers, and restaurant employees.

## Introduction

The three user interfaces are as follows:

**Customer Interface:** The customer can browse the menu, place orders, view order status, and provide feedback on their dining experience.

**Employee Interface:** Restaurant employees, such as waitstaff and kitchen staff, can access order details, update order status, and manage inventory.

## Features
The Restaurant Management System offers the following key features:

**User Management:** Each user type has a unique set of permissions and access levels within the system.

**Menu Management:** The manager can add, edit, or remove menu items, including their descriptions, prices, and availability.

**Order Management:** Customers can place orders, view their order status, and receive notifications. Employees can manage and update order status.

**Reservation Management:** Customers can make table reservations and view their reservation details.

**Inventory Management:** Employees can track inventory levels and receive notifications when supplies need to be restocked.

**Reporting and Analytics:** The manager can generate various reports, such as sales reports, employee performance reports, and inventory reports for informed decision-making.
